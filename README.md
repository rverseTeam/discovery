# Discovery

A reference implementation of the Discovery system that the 3DS and Wii U need to connect to Miiverse.

The patch was made by Stary and Sono and released with permission.

Build the patch using armips and an uncompressed code.bin of the Miiverse applet (look at 3dbrew for the title IDs of Miiverse).
